===========================================================
Highest Severity Rating: High
Confirmed Affected Versions: 23.1.11_1, 23.7.3, 23.7.4
Confirmed Patched Versions: Commit 484753b2abe3fd0fcdb73d8bf00c3fc3709eb8b7

Summary and Impact
------------------
The OPNsense dashboard displays widgets with information about the
system, running services, gateways and more. These widgets can be
arranged in different orders and columns. The values for the number of
columns and the order of widgets are stored server-side and are the same
for all users of an OPNsense instance. They are reflected unmodified on
every visit. This can be abused by a low-privileged attacker to inject
their own content into the page, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack that can result in privilege escalation.


Product Description
-------------------
OPNsense is an open source, FreeBSD-based firewall and routing operating
system. It includes many features of commercial firewalls and can be
managed entirely via its web GUI.


Stored XSS in the OPNsense Dashboard via the column_count Parameter
===================================================================
Severity Rating: High
Vector: Network
CWE: 79
CVSS Score: 8.0
CVSS Vector: 3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Analysis
--------
The number of columns displayed in the dashboard is set via an HTTP POST
request to /index.php, using the column_count request parameter. This
parameter is not properly escaped when returned to the client. To
exploit this issue, the payload "><script>alert(1)</script> is submitted
as part of the column_count parameter. This input is reflected
unmodified in the response and on any subsequent visit to the dashboard
by any user. Only the "Lobby: Login / Logout / Dashboard" permission is
required to abuse this issue.

Once the server receives the POST request, the column_count parameter is
written unmodified into the configuration:

} elseif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && !empty($_POST['origin'])
                && $_POST['origin'] == 'dashboard') {
        // ...
        if (!empty($_POST['column_count'])) {
            $config['widgets']['column_count'] = $_POST['column_count'];
        } elseif(isset($config['widgets']['column_count'])) {
            unset($config['widgets']['column_count']);
        }
        write_config('Widget configuration has been changed');
        header(url_safe('Location: /index.php'));
        exit;
}
// from:
// 
https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/2306449329e462364c07317b23a1f257779a4fc8/src/www/index.php#L66-L79

If the column_count parameter is not empty, it is used unmodified:

// ...
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'GET') {
        $pconfig = $config['widgets'];
        // ...
        $pconfig['column_count'] =
           !empty($pconfig['column_count']) ? $pconfig['column_count'] : 2;
        // ...
// from:
// 
https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/306449329e462364c07317b23a1f257779a4fc8/src/www/index.php#L42

Below, the unmodified value is written:

<!-- ... -->
<section class="page-content-main">
      <form method="post" id="iform">
        <input type="hidden" value="dashboard" name="origin" id="origin" />
        <input type="hidden" value="" name="sequence" id="sequence" />
        <input type="hidden" value="<?= $pconfig['column_count'];?>"
            name="column_count" id="column_count_input" />
      </form>
<!-- ... -->
<!-- from:
https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/306449329e462364c07317b23a1f257779a4fc8/src/www/index.php#L332
-->

Proof of Concept
----------------
Log in as root. On the left side, go to System -> Access -> Users, and
add a new user. For "Effective Privileges", only select "Lobby: Login /
Logout / Dashboard". The user is now only able to view the dashboard and
the help pages.

Log in as that newly created user and open your browser's network
monitor. In the OPNsense dashboard, select "1 column" from the top right
and then press "save settings". Repeat the POST request and replace the
column_count variable with

column_count=1"><script>alert(1)</script>

Now, log in as admin again, you should see an alert box resulting from
the following HTML response:

<form method="post" id="iform">
        <!-- .. -->
        <input type="hidden" value="1">
            <script>alert(1)</script>"
            name="column_count" id="column_count_input" />
</form>

This is the stored XSS and can result in privilege escalation. The
OPNsense developers did apply a Content-Security-Policy, but
unfortunately allow unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval for scripts, which
does not prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability.

Analysis
--------
The order in which the widgets are displayed in the Dashboard is set via
an HTTP POST request to /index.php, using the sequence request
parameter. This parameter is not properly escaped when returned to the
client. To exploit this issue, the payload "><script>alert(1)</script>
is submitted as part of the sequence parameter. This input is reflected
unmodified in the response and on any subsequent visit to the dashboard
by any user. Only the "Lobby: Login / Logout / Dashboard" permission is
required to abuse this issue.

The order in which widgets are displayed on the dashboard can be set in
the same POST request, via the sequence parameter. The sequence
parameter has the following format:

sequence=services_status-container:00000000-col3:show,
        interface_list-container:00000001-col4:show,
        gateways-container:00000002-col4:show

Once the server receives the POST request, the sequence parameter is
written unmodified into the configuration:

} elseif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && !empty($_POST['origin'])
                && $_POST['origin'] == 'dashboard') {
        if (!empty($_POST['sequence'])) {
            $config['widgets']['sequence'] = $_POST['sequence'];
        } elseif (isset($config['widgets']['sequence'])) {
            unset($config['widgets']['sequence']);
        }
        // ...
        write_config('Widget configuration has been changed');
        header(url_safe('Location: /index.php'));
        exit;
}
// from:
// 
https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/cbaf7cee1f0a6fabd1ec4c752a5d169c402976dc/src/www/index.php#L66-L80

When serving a GET request, the sequence parameter is returned
unmodified, starting with a read of its value from the configuration:

// ...
$pconfig = $config['widgets'];
// set default dashboard view
$pconfig['sequence'] = !empty($pconfig['sequence']) ?
        $pconfig['sequence'] : '';
// ...
// from:
// 
https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/2306449329e462364c07317b23a1f257779a4fc8/src/www/index.php#L39-L41

sequence is then split by comma and further split by colon into name,
sortKey, and state. The list of widgets is sorted on the server side
using the sortKey.

$widgetSeqParts = explode(",", $pconfig['sequence']);
foreach (glob('/usr/local/www/widgets/widgets/*.widget.php') as $php_file) {
        $widgetItem = array();
        // [...]
        foreach ($widgetSeqParts as $seqPart) {
            $tmp = explode(':', $seqPart);
            if (count($tmp) == 3 &&
                explode('-', $tmp[0])[0] == $widgetItem['name']
            ) {
                $widgetItem['state'] = $tmp[2];
                $widgetItem['sortKey'] = $tmp[1];
            }
        }
        $widgetCollection[] = $widgetItem;
}
// sort widgets
usort($widgetCollection, function ($item1, $item2) {
        return strcmp(strtolower($item1['sortKey']),
            strtolower($item2['sortKey']));
});
// from:
//

Finally, the sortKey is written unescaped into an HTML attribute:

<section
        class="widgetdiv"
        data-sortkey="<?=$widgetItem['sortKey'] ?>"
        id="<?=$widgetItem['name'];?>"
        style="display:<?=$divdisplay;?>;"

Log in as that newly created user and open your browser's network
monitor. In the OPNsense dashboard, reorder the widgets via drag-and-
drop, then press "save settings".

Repeat the POST request and replace the sequence variable with

sequence=gateways-container:1"><script>alert(1)</script>-col4:show

Now, log in as admin again, you should see an alert box resulting from
the following HTML response:

<div class="container-fluid">
        <!-- ... -->
            <section class="widgetdiv" data-sortkey="1">
                <script>alert(2)</script>
                -col4" id="gateways"  style="display:block;">

This is the stored XSS and can result in privilege escalation.

The OPNsense developers did apply a Content-Security-Policy, but
unfortunately allow unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval for scripts, which
does not prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability.


Workarounds
===========

Remove all effective privileges for /index.php* of low-privilege users.
