This directory allows the user to enable and configure additional lighttpd modules for the OPNsense webgui, or
specify additional configurations for modules that are enabled already in /usr/local/etc/inc/plugins.d/webgui.inc

Relevant lighttpd modules available: https://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Docs#Modules

The user can create and configure their own configuration files in this directory, or copy, rename and adapt example
configurations already included in this directory

To use the functionality of this directory:

- create a suitably named file with the extension .conf in this directory, either by copying and renaming an example already included,
  or creating your own

- if necessary, enable the applicable lighttpd module in that file by including:

    server.modules += ( "mod_[NAME]" )
  
  (for example: server.modules += ( "mod_extforward" )

- specify the relevant configurations for the module, according to the lighttpd documentation

In some cases, the order in which modules are enabled by lighttpd is important. Modules which gate requests
(eg mod_access, mod_auth) or modify requests (eg mod_alias, mod_setenv) should be listed before modules which
complete requests (eg mod_redirect, mod_rewrite), and which, in turn, should be listed before dynamic handlers
(eg mod_cgi, mod_fastcgi, mod_proxy, mod_scgi, ...)

To address this, you will need to ensure that the relevant configuration files appear in this directory in the
right order. Begin the files with appropriate numbering (such as 01- and 02-) to achieve that
