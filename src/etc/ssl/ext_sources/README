OPNsense certificates used by external applications and registered in the gui for viewing purposes only.

In this directory you can create files with a .conf extension (e.g. myapp.conf) with the following (sample) config:

[location]
base=/usr/local/md/domains
pattern=pubcert.pem
description=OPNWAF


"base" is the directory to recursively iterate, "pattern" is a regex matcher and each item returned will have a description
attached to it for the frontend.

Files found can be identified by their id, which is an md5 hash of the contents.
