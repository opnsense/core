.Nm
.Op Fl AaCefHilNnsVvwx
.Op Ar package
.Nm
.Fl cO
.Fl R Ar tag
.Op Ar package
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility emits build-time package metadata, e.g. version numbers
and product-related information for branding capabilities.
.Pp
Callers use this metadata to configure the system, return user
information or to construct links for firmware upgrades using
.Xr opnsense-update 8 .
It is similar to
.Xr opnsense-verify 8 Ap s
.Sq Fl a
parameter, but not intended to handle operating system information.
.Pp
The default package is assumed to be
.Ar core ,
unless another package has been specified.
Other packages can be
.Ar base ,
.Ar kernel ,
or plugin names.
.Pp
Multiple options can be specified to build a custom version string
when that information is available.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl a" -offset indent
.It Fl A
Return the system architecture string.
.It Fl a
Return the firmware ABI string.
.It Fl C
Return a space separated list of known product conflicts.
.It Fl c
Exit successfully if the package exists.
Otherwise, exit with an error.
.It Fl e
Return the product contact e-mail address.
.It Fl H
Return the package commit hash.
.It Fl i
Return the package nickname.
.It Fl l
Return the lock status.
Currently limited to sets operated by
.Xr opnsense-update 8 .
.It Fl N
Return the product name.
.It Fl n
Return the package name.
.It Fl O
Return the full raw version data.
.It Fl R

Return the support tier level of the package.
.It Fl V

.It Fl v
Return the package version.
.It Fl w

manipulating the target ABI going to and away from
the business mirror.
