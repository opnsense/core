            Message cache elements are prefetched before they expire to help keep the cache up to date.
            When enabled, this option can cause an increase of around 10% more DNS traffic and load
            on the server, but frequently requested items will not expire from the cache.

            round-trip to the authority servers. If too many queries arrive, then 50% of the queries are allowed

            already spent more than their allowed time. This protects against denial of service by
            slow queries or high query rates.
