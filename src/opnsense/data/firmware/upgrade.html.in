<p>OPNsense %%CORE_SERIES%% "<em>%%CORE_NICKNAME%%</em>" has reached its end
of life. As such it will not receive any more updates, but the upgrade to the
new %%CORE_NEXT%% series is seamless and can be performed right here from the
web GUI.</p>
<p> Another method is to import and reinstall using a new installation image,
which will retain your settings using "Import Configuration", then reformat
the disk and apply a clean system using either "Install (ZFS)" or "Install
(UFS)".</p>
<p>You can also upgrade via console / SSH by using option 12 from the menu by
typing "%%UPGRADE_RELEASE%%" when prompted.</p>
<p>Make sure to read the migration notes and account for possible breaking changes.</p>
<p>Please backup your configuration, preview the new version via live image or
in a virtual machine. If applicable, create VM snapshots or use the built-in
snapshot feature available on ZFS installations. If all else fails, report back
<a href="https://forum.opnsense.org/" target="_blank">in the forums</a> for
assistance.</p>
