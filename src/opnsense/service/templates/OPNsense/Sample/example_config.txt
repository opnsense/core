{% extends "/OPNsense/Sample/example_parent.txt" %}
{% block content %}

For demonstration purposes this template is based upon another template in the OPNsense/Sample module.
The block named "content" is replaced with this data

In the +TARGETS file, the name of the output is describes as elements of the config data, because we will receive
all of the config.xml data when rendering this template, we have to filter the parts we need.

For example, only use this interfaces data:

{% for key,item in interfaces.items() %}
    {% if TARGET_FILTERS['interfaces.'+key] %}
       my interface name is {{ key }}, connected to {{ item.if }} using {{ item.ipaddr }}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endblock %}
