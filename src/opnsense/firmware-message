<p>OPNsense 18.1 "<em>Groovy Gecko</em>" is almost end of life. As such
it will not receive any more updates, but the upgrade to the new 18.7 series is
seamless and can be performed right here from the GUI by unlocking it below.</p>
<p> Another method is to import and reinstall using a new installation image,
which will retain your settings (selecting "Import Configuration"), then
reformat the disk and apply a clean system (selecting "Guided Installation").</p>
<p>You can also upgrade via console / SSH by using option 12 from the menu by
typing "18.7" when prompted.</p>
<p>Please backup your configuration, preview the new version via live image or
in a virtual machine. Create snapshots. If all else fails, report back
<a href="https://forum.opnsense.org/" target="_blank">in the forums</a> for
assistance.</p>
