    ContextManager wrapper for a DuckDb connection. Use this to synchronize
    access to a DuckDb instance in cases where there is both a writer and
    one or more readers. Since this isn't natively supported by DuckDb,
    the assumption here is that both the reader and the writer can afford
    to block for the duration of an arbitrary operation of its counterpart.
    For example, when a reader has a connection, a writer blocks until the readers drops
    the connection and vice versa. The use of this ContextManager therefore forces
    a connection to only last for the duration of its operation.
